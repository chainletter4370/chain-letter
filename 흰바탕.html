        <div class="quote">

"This letter originated in England and has brought good fortune to those who<br>
receive it as it makes its way around the world once a year. This letter has<br>
now been passed on to you, and it must leave your hands within 24 hours. You<br>
are required to send 16 copies of this letter to people who need good luck.<br>
While it may seem superstitious, it is indeed true.<br><br>
In 1930, a man named HGXWCH in England received this letter. He instructed his<br>
secretary to make copies and send them out. A few days later, he won the<br>
lottery and received 2 billion. Someone else received this letter but forgot<br>
that it had to leave his hands within 24 hours. Soon after, he was fired from<br>
his job. Realizing his mistake, he sent out 16 copies of the letter and later<br>
secured a good job. President Kennedy of the United States received this<br>
letter but discarded it. Nine days later, he was assassinated.<br><br>
Remember, if you send out 16 copies of this letter, you will receive good<br>
fortune. If you do not, misfortune will follow. And under no circumstances<br>
should you discard or deface this letter. Send out 16 copies. Good fortune and<br>
wealth will come to those who receive this letter."

        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
The world's oldest meme, the Chain Letter, is reborn on the blockchain<br>
through onchain messages exclusively possible with ERC-20.<br><br>
When you purchase 100 LETTER tokens on Uniswap, you will automatically<br>
receive a lucky letter. At the same time, a lucky letter will be sent to one<br>
of the million active BASE addresses with at least one swap record. Avoid<br>
misfortune and share the luck. Once all one million letters are sent, the<br>
market cap will reach a billion.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
        <div class="tokenomics">
            <p>
3/3 tax. Tax will be used as postage costs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Reward</h2>
        <div class="reward">
            <p>
The last digit of an ERC-20 address is determined according to the<br>
hexadecimal system, which uses numbers 0-9 and letters A-F. Therefore, the<br>
last digit of an EVM address will be one of the following 16 possible<br>
values;<br><br>
Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9<br>
Letters: A, B, C, D, E, F<br><br>
When you purchase 100 LETTER tokens, a lucky letter is sent to one of the<br>
million active BASE addresses. If you send 16 lucky letters, there will be<br>
at least one match where the last digit of your address matches the<br>
recipient's. When the last digit of both addresses matches, the goddess of<br>
luck will reward you with 6 LETTER tokens, which is double the purchase tax,<br>
following ancient tradition.
            </p>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <div class="roadmap">
            <p>
Phase 1: 10,000 letters sent. Those who haven't received a letter suffer<br>
from FOMO.<br><br>
Phase 2: 100,000 letters sent. Luck devours misfortune.<br><br>
Phase 3: 1,000,000 letters sent. Marketcap reaches $1B
